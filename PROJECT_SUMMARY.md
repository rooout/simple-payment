## 🔧 Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. Configure Xendit Keys
Update `.env` file with your real Xendit credentials:
```env
XENDIT_SECRET_KEY=xnd_production_your_real_secret_key
XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY=xnd_public_production_your_real_public_key
XENDIT_CALLBACK_TOKEN=your_real_callback_token
```

### 2. Deploy to Cloud Platform
Choose one of these free options:
- **Railway** (Recommended): Easy GitHub integration
- **Heroku**: Popular platform with good documentation
- **Render**: Simple deployment process
- **PythonAnywhere**: Good for beginners

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

### 3. Configure Xendit Webhooks
In your Xendit dashboard, set webhook URL to:
```
https://your-deployed-app.com/callback/xendit/
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Local Testing:
1. Start server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Visit: http://localhost:8000
3. Test with Xendit test API keys first
4. Use test card numbers from Xendit docs

### Production Testing:
1. Deploy to cloud platform
2. Configure production API keys
3. Test actual payments with small amounts
4. Verify webhook callbacks work

## 💡 Key Features Highlights

### For Users:
- **Simple UX**: No registration required
- **Multiple Payment Options**: VA, Cards, QR Code
